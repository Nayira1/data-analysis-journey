# Day 2 – Python Todo List Manager 📝

This is a simple command-line todo list script written in Python.

## Concepts used:
- `if` / `elif` / `else`
- `while` loops
- `try` / `except`
- `list.append()`, `list.remove()`
- `input()` handling

## How it works:
The script allows the user to:
- Add tasks
- View current tasks
- Delete tasks
- End the program
